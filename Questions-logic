1. Middle of LL 
          approach -> using slow fast pointer 
2. Reverse LL in groups of K 
          approach -> solve 1 case call recursion, then link head-> next = Recursions's ans , return prev 
3. Check LL is circular or not  
          approach -> 2 pointer approach slow, fast pointer 
4.Detect and delete loop 
          1. detect 
          2. return starting point 
          3. remove 
5. Palindrom check 
          approach -> how to do ?? 
                    1. find Mid using 2 pointer 
                    2. Now reverse from slow->next to NULL using 3 variable
                    3. start comparison using LOOP head with reverse pointer if diff return false
